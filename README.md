## Overview 
This is a simple example showing how to load client side json files in to a PLC structure.  

## Video Tutorial
There is a free coding byte video tutorial on this code which can be found [here](https://beckhoff-au.teachable.com/courses/coding-bytes-twincat-hmi/lectures/35610771)

## Getting Started
Activate and run the PLC project.  Open Main.view in liveview, swap live view to a real browser (as normal live view does not support loading) and load the example.json file. 

## Code Snippets
The following section of code is the mechanisim behind the loading and writing. 

```javascript
function LoadJson() {

    if (typeof FileReader === 'undefined') {
        console.log('File loading not supported by your browser');
        return;
    }

    var inputElement = document.createElement('input');

    inputElement.type = 'file';
    inputElement.accept = '.json';
    inputElement.multiple = false;

    inputElement.addEventListener('change', function(data) {

        if (inputElement.files) {

            var file = inputElement.files[0];
            var reader = new FileReader();

            reader.addEventListener('loadend', function(load_data) {

                if (reader.result) {
                    var myJson = JSON.parse(reader.result);

                    TcHmi.Symbol.writeEx('%s%PLC1.GVL.myArray%/s%', myJson, function(data) {
                        if (data.error === TcHmi.Errors.NONE) {
                            console.log('ok');
                        } else {
                            console.log('error');
                        }
                    });

                }

            });
            reader.addEventListener('error', function(load_data) {
                console.log('File load error');
            });

            reader.readAsText(file);

        }
    });

    inputElement.click();
    return;
}
```
